This paper, on the one hand, proposes a statistical technique to detect potential causal relationships when the researcher has georeferenced data but not time dimension, and, on the other, applies this new methodology to the analysis of potential partial causal determinants of home prices. In particular, we find that the direction of causality for home prices in California goes from the income level to prices.
